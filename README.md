# Lixeira Inteligente

## Description

With the growing need for recycling, the Intelligent Recycle Bin emerges as a simple and efficient method of separating recyclable waste, making it more accessible and simple for people in their homes, to properly separate the recyclable waste that it produces, and then to properly dispose of it. recycling plant.

## How it works?

The separation process is very simple, it consists only of 3 sensors where each one detects a type of material from the waste, and 3 servomotors that take each waste to a different compartment. All of this is managed by a microcontroller, who are responsible for correctly determining and disposing of waste according to its material, just build an identification and separation module through the detailed step by step. With that, you will set up your own trash can, and in the end, you will still have learned a little about programming and prototyping.

## Collaboration

Since the purpose of the Intelligent Recycle Bin is to assist in the separation and recycling process, it was fully developed with the GPL v3 license in mind. And what does that mean? This means that ALL the project is available in this repository on GitHub, and with that, in addition to having access to all documents, files and codes of the project, you can also suggest changes to them, and thus contribute to the development, legal not ? So come on, and help us transform the world!
